# Lagrange-Interpolation-Visualiser
The Lagrange interpolation formula is a way to find a polynomial which takes on certain values at arbitrary points. 
Specifically, it gives a constructive proof of the theorem below.

This theorem can be viewed as a generalization of the well-known fact that two points uniquely determine a straight line, three points uniquely determine the graph of a quadratic polynomial, four points uniquely determine the graph of a cubic polynomial, and so on. (Two caveats: (1) the points are required to have different x-coordinates, and (2) the "quadratic polynomial" might actually be a linear or constant polynomial, the "cubic polynomial" might actually be a quadratic, linear, or constant polynomial, and so on.)

The application lets the user enter the desired X and Y values for the wanted polynomial (also can enter the initial polynomial for the comparison in the input above). The found polynomial is drawn in the plotter to the left.
